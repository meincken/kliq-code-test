## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For simplicity and rapid development I have kept most of the tailwindcss inline. As you can see I have also broken this down into more manageable atoms and molecules (components).

There is a single client component for the promotion table, I could see an opportunity for other components like this, but didn't really have the time to extend those due to time constraints.

I would have liked to have added and configured stylelint for tailwind.

I would have cleaned up the structure a lot more but didn't have the time from my initial code set up. but as you can see it's a pretty basic structure and easy to maintain and update.
